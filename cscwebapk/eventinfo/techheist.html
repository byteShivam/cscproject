        <p>
            Tech Heist is an exciting event organized by Chandrabhan Sharma College that challenges participants to showcase their technical skills and compete in two different competitions: web development and debugging. <br><br>

            The web development competition tests participants' ability to design and develop a website based on a given theme or topic. Participants will be judged based on the quality of their website's design, functionality, and overall user experience. The debugging competition challenges participants to identify and fix programming errors in a provided codebase within a set amount of time. The participant who successfully identifies and fixes the most errors will be declared the winner.</p>
