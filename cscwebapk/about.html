            <p>elcome to Chandrabhan Sharma College(CS College) website. I appreciate the interest shown in our website. <br>

              I strongly believe that, ‘every student has immense potential to succeed’ and ‘every teacher has immense positive power to influence his student’. <br>
              
              As young institution of learning, it is our collective passion and aspiration to make a difference in the lives of students of this institution. <br>

              Always aim high. You surely have the potential to become perfect in life. Don’t be lazy and postpone things. If you really wish and work hard nothing can stop you to live a life of joy and achievement.</p>
